## About The Project
<!-- Add Image of project -->
As you may have guessed this repo is for the home security systems created using the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. The goal for this project is a **full** home automated security system designed by myself which means this project will likely not be completed for a very, _very_ long time.

## Getting Started

I'll outline some basic steps to help you replicate this project yourself.

### Hardware

* [Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W](https://core-electronics.com.au/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-wireless.html)
* Internal laptop webcam
* _Local Server_

### Tools

* Soldering Iron

### Installation

> To be completed

## Usage

<!-- Add Images of project -->
This project is best used as a personal home security system. With the ability to custom make the project you have the freedom to naturally blend in the camera and other peices of hardware into the environment in order to keep the data being recorded incase of actual emergency. I personally would suggest only transferring the files locally within your network and not to any clouds but of course if you make this yourself you can do as you please.

If you wanted to add facial recognition I would suggest [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). I opted to not use this to make this project as light weight as possible and not hinder any performance but I do see application in it being used instead of motion detection.

## Roadmap

 - [ ] Security Camera
   - [ ] Have Raspberry Pi locally capturing and storing video and audio
   - [ ] Setup a local server and use SFTP to move data between devices
   - [ ] Setup a live feed over the local network
   - [ ] Use motion detection on the Raspberry Pi. Send alerts to the live feed and create a log
 - [ ] Smart Door Bell
 - [ ] Door Sensors
